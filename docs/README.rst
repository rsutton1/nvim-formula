Commit messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Commit message formatting is significant!!**

Please see `How to contribute <https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ for more details.

pre-commit
^^^^^^^^^^

`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ is configured for this formula, which you may optionally use to ease the steps involved in submitting your changes.
First install  the ``pre-commit`` package manager using the appropriate `method <https://pre-commit.com/#installation>`_, then run ``bin/install-hooks`` and
now ``pre-commit`` will run automatically on each ``git commit``. ::

  $ bin/install-hooks
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/commit-msg

None

Available states
----------------

.. contents::
   :local:

``nvim``
^^^^^^^^

*Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)*.

This installs the nvim package,
manages the nvim configuration file and then
starts the associated nvim service.

``nvim.package``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will install the nvim package only.

``nvim.config``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will configure Neovim by creating the init.vim file.


``nvim.config.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will remove the configuration of the nvim service.

Testing
-------

Linux testing is done with ``kitchen-salt``.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Ruby
* Docker

.. code-block:: bash

   $ gem install bundler
   $ bundle install
   $ bin/kitchen test [platform]

Where ``[platform]`` is the platform name defined in ``kitchen.yml``,
e.g. ``debian-9-2019-2-py3``.

``bin/kitchen converge``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates the docker instance and runs the ``nvim`` main state, ready for testing.

``bin/kitchen verify``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs the ``inspec`` tests on the actual instance.

``bin/kitchen destroy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removes the docker instance.

``bin/kitchen test``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. ``destroy`` + ``converge`` + ``verify`` + ``destroy``.

``bin/kitchen login``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
